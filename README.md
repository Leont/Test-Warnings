# NAME

Test::Warnings - Test for warnings and the lack of them

# VERSION

version 0.001

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;
    use Test::Warnings;

    pass('yay!');
    done_testing;

emits TAP:

    ok 1 - yay!
    ok 2 - no (unexpected) warnings (via done_testing)
    1..2

# DESCRIPTION

If you've ever tried to use [Test::NoWarnings](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::NoWarnings) to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of `done_testing` to
not have to declare a
[test count](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More#I love it-when-a-plan-comes-together),
you'll have discovered that these two features do not play well together,
as the test count will be calculated _before_ the warnings test is run,
resulting in a TAP error. (See `examples/test_nowarnings.pl` in this
distribution for a demonstration.)

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
[Test::NoWarnings](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::NoWarnings): it also adds an extra test, but runs this test _before_
`done_testing` calculates the test count, rather than after.  It does this by
hooking into `done_testing` as well as via an `END` block.  You can declare
a plan, or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur.  You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with `use Test::Warnings;` whether or not your tests have a plan.

# FUNCTIONS

The following functions are available for import (not included by default):

- `allow_warnings([bool])`

    When passed a true value, or no value at all, subsequent warnings will not
    result in a test failure; when passed a false value, subsequent warnings will
    result in a test failure.  Initial value is `false`.

- `allowing_warnings`

    Returns whether we are currently allowing warnings (set by `allow_warnings`
    as described above).

- `had_no_warnings(<optional test name>)`

    Tests whether there have been any warnings so far, not preceded by an
    `allowing_warnings` call.  It is run
    automatically at the end of all tests, but can also be called manually at any
    time, as often as desired.

All functions are also available by importing the tag `:all`.

# TO DO (i.e. FUTURE FEATURES, MAYBE)

- `allow_warnings(qr/.../)` - allow some warnings and not others
- `warning_is, warning_like etc...` - inclusion of some
[Test::Warn](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Warn)\-like functionality for testing the content of warnings, but
closer to a [Test::Fatal](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Fatal)\-like syntax
- more sophisticated handling in subtests - if we save some state on the
[Test::Builder](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Builder) object itself, we can allow warnings in a subtest and then
the state will revert when the subtest ends, as well as check for warnings at
the end of every subtest via `done_testing`.
